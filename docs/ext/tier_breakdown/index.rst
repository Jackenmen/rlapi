``rlapi.ext.tier_breakdown`` -- Tier breakdown providers support
================================================================

``rlapi`` provides option to supply `rlapi.Client` object with tier breakdown,
but the user has to create it manually. This extension makes generating
tier breakdown easier by downloading it from bigger providers like
`rltracker.pro`_, `rocketleague.tracker.network`_, or `rlstats.net`_.
